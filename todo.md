- tabs
  - bar plot of hospitals and their values
  - pie chart of hospital count per state

- dynamic title, linked with outcome

- nice to have
  - make it possible to show non-numeric columns, but not include in outcome list
  - make outcome selector a list with named values
  - download view
  - multiple states
  - navigation with # routes (as in Backbone.js)

- cheat sheet: 
  - subset(x, ColName == val) == subset(x, x[,colnum] == val)
